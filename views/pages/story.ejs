          Dear students, <br><br>

          Welcome to the new school year! I am Principal Newstown, the new principal of your middle school. Today is my first day as principal, and I want to share with you two new initiatives that I have already started on. The first is the very website you are on!<br><br>

          Each student at our school now has access to “School Book”-- a website that allows you to share the latest school happenings among your classmates. Each day, you’ll get a handful of information that your peers have shared, and you can choose one piece to share with your followers. I hope that this new website will help us feel more connected and in-the-know as ever before!<br><br>

          The second initiative is perhaps even more exciting than the first. We are exploring the option of school uniforms! Of course, before we make this final decision, I’d like you all to weigh in. So this Friday, we will all vote on whether or not we should implement uniforms. Hang tight-- a decision will be made very soon!<br><br>

          Those are all of my announcements for now. Have a great end of the school year and talk with you all on Friday.<br><br>

          Sincerely,<br>
          Principal Newstown<br>

        </p> -->
